## About

Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has
asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.

## Ask

Sršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumer use non-Bellabeat smart devices.

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

To provide an answer to these questions, I will be taking a look at [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). This is a Kaggle data set that contains personal fitness tracker data, including physical activity, heart rate, weight, and sleep.
Our analysis will be geared towards one, or a selection of the following Bellabeat products:

-**Bellabeat app**: Provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their habits and make healthy decisions.

-**Leaf**: Wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. Tracks activity, sleep, and stress.

-**Time**: A smart watch that tracks user activity, sleep, and stress.

-**Spring**: Water bottle that tracks daily water intake.

-**Bellabeat Membership**: Subscription-based membership program for users that gives guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness.

## Data Source
The data provided has been licensed by CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic). The dataset contains 18 csv files (15 long, 3 wide). This dataset has been generated by respondents to a distributed survey between 03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016. Thirty users submitted their personal tracker data including physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

### Issues

-User gender is not revealed in the data. As Bellabeat is a company focusing on creating health and wellness products for women, this may be an issue. Other personal data of the users that aren't included are their age, ethnicity, or location. This may be an issue when it comes to specificity of the analysis for Bellabeat's target market.

-The sample size is of 30 users, over a short period of time. This shortcoming will make it difficult to ascertain long-term insights in to the users and their behavior.

## Data Cleaning
All data sets from [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) have been downloaded and will be analyzed.

In preparation for the analysis, the following packages will be loaded.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(data.table)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

Loading all CSV files with health data into a list.
```{r}
file_list <- list.files(path = "Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/", full.names = TRUE)
datasets <- lapply(file_list, fread)
names(datasets) <- gsub('.{11}$', '', basename(file_list))
```

Each file had been appended with "_merged.csv", which has been removed to ease referencing.

In order to begin analyzing the data, I need to be able to understand what I'm working with. I will be creating a summary of the data files showing the number of columns and rows, how many N/A fields, distinct IDs, and duplicates are found in each.
```{r}
ds_summary <- data.frame(
  sapply(datasets, nrow),
  sapply(datasets, ncol),
  sapply(datasets, FUN = function(x) {sum(is.na(x))}),
  sapply(datasets, FUN = function(x) {n_distinct(x[[1]])}),
  sapply(datasets, FUN = function(x) {sum(duplicated(x))})
)
names(ds_summary) <- c("# Rows", "# Columns", "# NA", "# Distinct ID", "# Duplicated")

ds_summary
```

-The summary indicates that most data sets have 33 Distinct IDs, other than *minuteSleep*, *heartrate_seconds*, *sleepDay*, and *weightLogInfo*.

-There are also 2 data sets that have duplicated data: *minuteSleep*, and *sleepDay*. 

-weightLogInfo is showing 65 NAs in the dataset. 

```{r}
sapply(datasets$weightLogInfo, FUN = function(x) {sum(is.na(x))})
```

-Upon further inspection, the NAs were all located within the column *Fat*. As there are a total of 67 rows in this data set, this column will not be useful with that much missing data.

#### Next Steps

-Remove duplicates from *minuteSleep* and *sleepDay*

-Drop the *Fat* column from *weightLogInfo*

```{r}
datasets$weightLogInfo <- select(datasets$weightLogInfo, -Fat)
datasets$sleepDay <- unique(datasets$sleepDay)
datasets$minuteSleep <- unique(datasets$minuteSleep)

ds_summary <- data.frame(
  sapply(datasets, nrow),
  sapply(datasets, ncol),
  sapply(datasets, FUN = function(x) {sum(is.na(x))}),
  sapply(datasets, FUN = function(x) {n_distinct(x[[1]])}),
  sapply(datasets, FUN = function(x) {sum(duplicated(x))})
)
names(ds_summary) <- c("# Rows", "# Columns", "# NA", "# Distinct ID", "# Duplicated")
ds_summary
```


## Analyzing the Data
```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(datasets$dailyActivity, mapping = aes(x = Calories, y = TotalSteps, color = Calories)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(title = "Total Steps vs Calories Burned", x = "Calories Burned") +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "#3182bd", high = "#fc8d59")
```

We can see a positive correlation between the calories burned and the total steps taken: the more steps you take, the greater the expected calorie burn.

Let's take a deeper look in to the daily activity and its summary statistics.

```{r,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
datasets$dailyActivity %>%  
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         VeryActiveMinutes,
         FairlyActiveMinutes,
         LightlyActiveMinutes,
         SedentaryMinutes) %>%
  summary()
```

This summary provides some great insight in to the activity of the users:

-On average, the users logged 7,638 steps per day. This number is below the recommended 10,000 [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/pdf/postcurriculum_session8.pdf)

-On average, a user will log 991.2 Sedentary Minutes per day.

-On average, Sedentary Minutes greatly outnumbered the aggregate of Very Active, Fairly Active, and Lightly Active Minutes.

## Recommendation

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

  - Users spend a majority of their time in a sedentary state

  - Users on average do not hit the CDC recommended daily steps or activity metrics

2. How could the above trends be used to inform Bellabeats decisions?
Bellabeats, being a health and wellness company, will benefit from the improvement in their users' lifestyle. Bellabeats can use these trends to gather insights in to how users' use their products and can figure out ways to encourage their users to increase their activity.

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
Bellabeats could develop strategies to increase their users' activity, for example, by issuing notifications at certain points during the day if the user is below the benchmark activity level, by issuing a notification to the user that their weekly average activity is below their goal, or other similar tactics. Bellabeats would be able to use any positive outcomes from these initiatives in order to market their products as a tool that will help users improve towards their health and wellness goals.
